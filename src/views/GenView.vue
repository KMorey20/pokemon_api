    <h2> What is a Generation?</h2>
      <p>
        A generation has two definitions in the Pokémon franchise:
      </p>
        
      <ul>
        <li>In the context of Pokémon games, a generation refers to a set of Pokémon species introduced in a specific game or series of games.</li>
        <li>In the context of Pokémon lore, a generation refers to the lineage or ancestry of Pokémon species.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        The Pokémon franchise has released multiple generations of games, each introducing new Pokémon species, 
        regions, and gameplay mechanics.The first generation started with Pokémon Red and Green in Japan, followed by 
        the international release of Pokémon Red and Blue. Subsequent generations have introduced new Pokémon species, 
        regions, and gameplay mechanics, expanding the Pokémon universe.
